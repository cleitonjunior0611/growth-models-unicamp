## 📁 Repository Structure

- **`Macro III Work - part 1.R`**: Analysis of GDP per capita convergence between selected countries and the US, using the Solow model (2000–2021).
- **`Macro III Work - part 2 v1.R`**: Balance-of-payments constrained growth model for Brazil and Mexico (1990–2021), with comparative analysis and temporal break (pre- and post-2003).

## 🎯 Objectives

### Part 1: Neoclassical Growth Model (Solow)
- Investigate evidence of **convergence** in GDP per capita relative to the US.
- Analyze the relationship between initial GDP and growth rate.
- Compare OECD and non-OECD countries.

### Part 2: Balance-of-Payments Constrained Growth Model
- Estimate growth compatible with external equilibrium for Brazil and Mexico.
- Compare actual growth versus balance-of-payments constrained growth.
- Analyze the impact of the commodities boom starting in 2003.
